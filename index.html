<h1>The AWARE team</h1>

In 1993 a LISTSERV mailinglist was created for Authorware Developer Aces.<br>
They first got together at the Macromedia User Conference in september 1993.<br>
Sharing knowledge, subscribers soon dominated the E-learning businesses that ruled since the mid 90s.<br>
Today, still close friends, they survive as developers and consultants of fortune.<br>
<br>
If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can identify them,<br>  
maybe you can hire the A-Team.<br>

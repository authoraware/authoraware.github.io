# The AWARE team

In 1993 a LISTSERV mailinglist was created for Authorware Developer Aces.  
They first got together at the Macromedia User Conference in september 1993.  
Sharing knowledge, subscribers soon dominated the E-learning businesses that ruled since the mid 90s.  
Today, still close friends, they survive as developers and consultants of fortune.  

If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can identify them,  
maybe you can hire the A-Team.

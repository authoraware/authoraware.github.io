# The AWARE team

In 1993 a LISTSERV mailinglist was created for Authorware Developer Aces.  
The first IRL meeting was at the Macromedia User Conference in **september 1994**  
Sharing knowledge with subscribers from all over the world,  
subscriber campanies soon dominated the E-learning businesses.  

Today, still close friends, they survive as developers and consultants of fortune.  

If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can email them,  
maybe you can hire the A-Team.

# The AWARE team

In 1993 a LISTSERV mailinglist was created for Authorware Developer Aces.  
Sharing knowledge subscribers soon dominated the E-learning businesses that ruled since the mid 90s.  
Today, still close friends, they survive as developers and consultants of fortune.  
If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can mail them,  
maybe you can hire the A-Team.
